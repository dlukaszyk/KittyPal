# KittyPal - Virtual Pet Simulator

**KittyPal** is a terminal-based virtual pet simulator where users can adopt and care for a virtual pet. The pet can be interacted with in various ways, such as feeding, playing, and resting, affecting its **hunger**, **health**, **energy**, and **happiness** levels. As you take care of your pet, youâ€™ll see its mood change based on its stats, and the pet will display different ASCII art to reflect its current state (e.g., happy, sad, sleepy, etc.).

## Features:
- **Feed**: Decreases hunger and increases health.
- **Play**: Increases happiness and decreases energy.
- **Sleep**: Restores energy.
- **Mood System**: ASCII art of the pet changes based on its stats (hunger, health, energy, happiness).
- **Terminal Interface**: Easy-to-use terminal interface for interaction.
