# KittyPal
KittyPal is a terminal-based virtual pet simulator where users can care for a pet by feeding it, playing with it, and resting. Interact with your pet and watch its mood change through ASCII art. A fun project to learn C++ and practice working with simple game mechanics and user interaction.
